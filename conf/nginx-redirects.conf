# Last time I updated, Jekyll was being fronted by nginx. I've been blogging since 2004 so the site
# has been through a whole number of different platforms, hosts and domains. I have, out of sheer
# force of will, tried to maintain the URLs for all those past sites.
#
# Likewise, when I moved on to Jekyll, I merged Tumblr posts in too.
#
# This config file defines how posts get remapped and restored.
#
# Server and capture old domains:
server {
