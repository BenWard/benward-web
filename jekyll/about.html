<hr>

<p>I graduated in Computation at the <a href="http://manchester.ac.uk">University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology</a> and I've been doing things with the internet for well over a decade. As well as writing software and building products, I present radio, and periodically I write, sometimes here.</p>

<h2>Elsewhere</h2>

<p>The internet is wonderfully decentralised, I'm usually identifiable with the handle <samp class="nickname">benward</samp>, or sometimes <samp class="nickname">bnwrd</samp>. I keep a <a rel="me" href="/network">a list of my profiles on various sites</a>.</p>

<h2>This site</h2>

<p>This site is maintained and hosted by myself, with help from the excellent, lightweight Ruby CMS <a href="jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It's a stock install, with various hacks and additions. You can learn about how it works by looking at the <a href="https://github.com/benward/benward">source code on Github</a>.

<h2>Disambiguation</h2>

<p>Inconveniently, there are others Bens Ward. Here follows a handy list of namesakes I've stumbled upon, whom you may be looking for instead:</p>
