<p><a class="fn n url" href="http://benward.uk" rel="me"><span class="given-name nickname">Ben</span> <span class="family-name">Ward</span></a> is a <span class="title">technologist</span>, software engineer and product manager from Cambridge (UK), currently residing in <span class="adr"><span class="locality">San Francisco</span></span>.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've been noodling with the internet for two decades, having graduated <a href="http://manchester.ac.uk"><abbr title="University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology">UMIST</abbr></a>, worked at major tech institutions such as Yahoo, Twitter, and Fitbit, and contributed to major web standards such as <a href="https://microformats.org">microformats</a> and CSS. In addition to writing software and building products, I serve as technical director and radio show host for local community station <a rel="employer" href="https://bff.fm">BFF.fm</a>, and sporadically like to write — sometimes even here on this blog.</p>

<p>For a more thorough professional summary, see <a class="url" href="https://linkedin.com/in/bnwrd" title="Ben Ward’s LinkedIn" rel="me">my LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>

<h2>Elsewhere</h2>

<p>The internet is wonderfully decentralised, I'm usually identifiable with the handle <samp class="nickname">benward</samp>, or sometimes <samp class="nickname">bnwrd</samp>. I maintain a <a rel="me" href="/network">directory of my profiles on various social and media sites</a>.</p>

<h2>This site</h2>

<p>This site is maintained and hosted by myself, using the excellent <a href="jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> static site generator. It's a stock install with various hacks bolted on, in particular to generate the persistent calendar-based archives. You can learn about how it works by looking at the <a href="https://github.com/benward/benward-web">source code on Github</a>.

<h2>Disambiguation</h2>

<p>Inconveniently, there are <em>other Bens Ward</em>. Here follows a handy list of namesakes I've stumbled upon, whom you may be looking for instead. It does not include the ones who keep trying to reset my Instagram password.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.benward.tv">Ben Ward, comedian, television writer and showrunner, UK.</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://benwardmusic.com/">Ben Ward, musician, New York</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://twitter.com/Ben_Ward">Ben Ward, BMX stunt rider</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://crouchingbadger.com/">Ben Ward, network operations engineer, Oxfordshire, UK</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You could also have me confused with <a href="http://werd.io" rel="friend met">Ben Werdmüller</a>, who goes by the alias <samp>benwerd</samp>. We know each other. He's not me either.</p>
