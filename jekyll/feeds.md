# Feeds and Following

You can keep up with the content of this blog through a handful of different technical mechanisms.

* An atom feed of recent entries for your feed reader: <a rel="feed alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="/feed.atom">Link</a>
* A Twitter account—<span title="doyouseewhatIdidthere?">@benwwward</span>—will post a title and link for each new post on this site: <a class="twitter-follow-button" href="http://twitter.com/benwwward">Follow @benwwward</a>

You can also follow my main Twitter account, [@benward](https://twitter.com/benward).
