At Christmas last year, I left 1355 Market Street — Twitter HQ — for the last time in over 7 years. I finished my career at Twitter satisfied, proud of the work I'd done, not bitter, but also very, very tired. I'd put a great deal into my work, and atop Twitter's outsized impact on the world, was pretty entangled between my personal ambitions and Twitter's. For a messaging system so simple at its core, It's not been a simple company to work for nor one that's had to navigate simple social challenges. I enjoyed working in two roles, engineering and product management, and will always be grateful to the people who helped me learn to do those jobs better.

There is a point, though, where you have to take a break. Where you need to — as Twitter's core value states — “seek diverse perspectives” and find some different problems to solve, or new versions of the same problem from different places. It's going to be good for me to shed the defaults of Twitter's operation (open, public) when I think about what the *right* way is for people to communicate. When I think about the unforeseen shortcomings of everyone being thrown together in a  single space. When I think about every communication being broken into atomic parts. Both brilliant and the cause of so much contextual breakdown.

I find myself now still using Twitter a lot, and actually, freed from the shackles of representing an employer I'm much more comfortable just Tweeting things personally than I was before. Less pressure for them to be “valuable”. But also I find myself increasingly uncomfortable with the relentlessly real-time, no-history nature of it.

Yesterday the NYT published a letters page of contributions form self-identified Trump voters. The reaction inside my bubble on Twitter is incredulous. I don't think the letters page is terribly valuable except to note that these successive posits that are light on personal experience and repetitive in Fox News talking points. But the reaction on Twitter is that this shouldn't have been published. That by embracing this the NYT have somehow endorsed the viewpoints, or legalised their authors, and that this marks an appalling surrender to Trump's Facsist America and where are the letters from muslims, or homosexuals in the military, or…. The same breathlessness was present when the NYT published a single article profiling a modern American Nazi family. It was derided for presenting them in a soft-focus, humanising manner.

The problem I have with these reactions is that they react as if these articles are isolated. That somehow the appearance of one piece that doesn't overwhelmingly decry nazis, or a letters page that doesn't line-check each contributed letter might be, I don't know, the *only* piece of the American right that someone reads, and that will make up their entire viewpoint on the issue now and forever.

Knowledge is a body of work. This letters page isn't a revelation, but it's a confirmation of the insidious nature of Fox News agenda and people's willingness to project and protect it. I can read some of those letters and know a little more about the forces at work. The nazis haven't won because one page of the NYT didn't put a “Nazi's are bad” disclaimer front and center — the body of work in the NYT covers that.

Besides being very uncomfortable with our rush to invalidate anything that isn't “complete”, it's also a worry that we're mirroring our Twitter decontextualization onto articles. Tweets are torn down in isolation if they're not correctly caveated. We're not willing to wait for more, or to collate greater knowledge ourselves. We're tearing down the tools we need to acquire more complex knowledge, things that are only learned in aggregate. If we can't express things that are incomplete, unfinished, we're not going to get any smarter.

My time not working is not strongly defined, but I broadly understand that I need to find space for myself. That means following instincts on what to fill my time, but also find me rejecting this Very Real Time frothing.
